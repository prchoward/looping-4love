# looping-4love
A addition and multiplication quiz I made with the use of a lot of loops
Both the Multiplication Tables and Addition tables are created with count controlled loops
The constant Maximum quiz value represents the maximum of most times tables, 12
Use of boolean variable to control the loop iterations for the Do/While statement
For the quizzes, IF/Else Logic is used to count the number of correct answers represented by Correct++
All of the Quizzes/Tables are embedded within a Switch statement that connects user input with the Programs
