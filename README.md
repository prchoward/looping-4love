# looping-4love
Some fun loop projects I made
- Multiplication Tables and Addition tables are made with count controlled loops
- Whole loop is set to boolean var keepGoing to make sure loop does not go on infinitely
- Maximum Quiz Value constant is set to 12 because 12 is the maximum number in most addition/multip tables
- If/else logic is used in the quiz loops to increase the correct answer counter; correctAmt++
- Each sub-program choice is set to a Switch statement, to control user input
- Added logic to print errors and close program if user input is invalid
